<p class='ni'>Long Jim Briggs wandered into Al’s Dance Hall one night when “Captain Mac”
was drunk and throwing things.</p>

<p>She had splendid deep red hair and a skin as white as blanched almonds, and he
admired her extravagantly. As a child admires a Christmas tree. And
differently, too&mdash;very differently. He had even given up prospecting now and
then and made good money as a carpenter so that he could spend it on her. He
had spent it all, and he knew her very well, but he had never seen her drunk
before. He had been in such places a good deal, but he hadn’t got used to
seeing women drunk. It hurt him.</p>

<p>He was about to wander on out again when he heard one of the other girls say:</p>

<p>“She’s gonna pay for this all right! Al will make ’er come acrost with the
expenses of the whole damn’ place for a month for that big mirror she broke!”</p>

<p>Long Jim hesitated and then started toward her. She took a saucer from one of
the little tables and sailed it like a clay pigeon. It curved and hit him over
the eye. The blood ran down his cheek and everybody laughed. He wiped it away
with his handkerchief and put his hand on her arm just as she was going to
throw another saucer.</p>

<p>“Why, Rosie&mdash;” he said reproachfully, in his soft, rumbling bass, and stopped
helplessly. His soft black eyes looked out kindly above his soft brown
mustache and his great soft brown beard, and said what his tongue couldn’t
find the words for.</p>

<p>Captain Mac was madder than she was drunk. All her sensations and her thoughts
were combined in one ache, like the ache in a tooth, and she was biting upon
it savagely and taking a kind of satisfaction in the keen shoots of her pain.
She could have knifed Al that night out of hand and seen through stoically
whatever might have come of it, but Jim Briggs’ voice and his eyes were the
kind of things she had forgotten the existence of, and they slipped in under
her guard and pierced the quick of her.</p>

<p>She didn’t throw the other saucer, but suddenly Rosie Ellen McCarthy, a decent
Irish girl, looked out of her eyes and said with a flash of passionate
appeal&mdash;</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, Jim, take me out o’ this!”</p>

<p>Jim didn’t expect it. It touched him so deeply that he could only gulp and nod
his head. With his great height and bent shoulders and baggy clothes he looked
uncouth and awkward, standing beside painted, half nude Captain Mac in her
spangled dress. He looked around helplessly for something to cover her
shoulders with.</p>

<p>“This’ll do,” she said, stretching out her hand for a yellow scarf on the top
of a gilded upright piano.</p>

<p>She took it with one strong pull, slinging heedlessly along the floor in a
rain of broken bits half a dozen pieces of bric-a-brac that had rested upon
it.</p>

<p>Jim folded the gaudy stuff clumsily about her and took her by the arm and
started to go out, when Al came up and stood in front of him, dapper, suave
and touched with cynicism.</p>

<p>“There’s money owing me,” he said politely, “and she ain’t going nowhere till
it’s paid, see?”</p>

<p>The red surged into Jim’s cheeks, pale from working underground, and his voice
rose dangerously out of its soft rumble.</p>

<p>“There’s a hell of a lot more than money owing you, you God-forgotten little
skunk, and if you don’t get out o’ my way I’m liable to pay you the part of it
you ain’t lookin’ for!”</p>

<p>He kept his eye on the other’s hands and his muscles braced. If you started
things in Al’s place you finished them swiftly, or they finished you.</p>

<p>The white hairy fingers twitched into the expected signal and Jim swung the
bony mass of his fist against Al’s ear as he would have swung a pick into a
stubborn conglomeration of quartz. But that was incidental. He didn’t even
notice where the little man rolled. Jerked forward by Al’s signal, a very
different antagonist was coming on the jump&mdash;Hard Pan Schmitz, the dance hall
bouncer.</p>

<p>Jim Briggs was no match for him and knew it. Almost as if he had followed
through the blow that sent Al spinning, he snatched up a heavy lighted lamp,
whirled it above his head and flung it. It struck Schmitz’s raised forearm,
smashed down his guard and covered him with broken glass and burning oil.</p>

<p>In the stunned second before the racket began Jim took Rosie by the wrist and
broke through to the street. Behind them the place seethed like an ants’ nest
laid open by a spade.</p>

<p>He pulled her around the first corner. They pelted through the snow as fast as
she could run. He zigzagged his way through the town, taking alleys when he
could. They came at length to the door of a wooden shack below the level of
the sidewalk, on an unlighted street. Its unpainted boards were warped, it
listed heavily and, in common with all the other houses in the block, it
looked deserted. But Jim jumped down to it, key in hand, and by the time Rosie
had descended the rickety steps that led from the sidewalk he had opened the
door.</p>

<p>He shut it behind her, struck a match and led the way into a room furnished
with a stove, a camp cot, a chair and a small pine table with a smoke
blackened lamp on it. He lighted the lamp. Rosie fell into the chair,
breathing in big painful gulps. She wasn’t used to running. The great
altitude&mdash;ten thousand feet&mdash;had played havoc with her breath. Jim had swung a
pick there too long to be much affected. They looked at each other in the dim
light.</p>

<p>“It’s jest a place to sleep,” he said awkwardly. “Nobody knows I own it.
Feller gave it to me that struck it rich an’ went away. Mostly I’m in the
hills anyhow. So wouldn’t anybody look for us here.”</p>

<p>And then:</p>

<p>“The sheriff and the marshal’s both down on Al. If we can get away without
bein’ noticed, it ain’t likely anybody’ll foller.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’d be safe for you to stay, then,” said Rosie, when she had breath
enough to say anything.</p>

<p>“Maybe. But I was aimin’ to go anyhow. Why don’t you go with me, an’&mdash;an’ stay
with me?”</p>

<p>She looked at him steadily.</p>

<p>“I ain’t fit.”</p>

<p>“You’re as fit as I am,” he said quietly, in the soft, rumbling, reassuring
bass that seemed kin to rivers and winds. “What d’you say to a clean break an’
a new start together?” He lingered on the last word wistfully. “I’ve been
pretty lonesome, you know, a-knockin’ round from one prospect hole to another
an’ livin’ like a pack rat.”</p>

<p>She got up and came close and looked at him intently. The yellow piano scarf
that covered her befrizzled red head like an incongruous cowl and clashed
crudely with her red dress; her silver slippers, her spangles, the bunch of
cotton roses at her waist, her rouged cheeks and scarlet lips and half-bared
heaving breasts contrasted strangely with her honest eyes.</p>

<p>“Do you want it for yourself, Jim?”</p>

<p>“For myself&mdash;more’n anything.”</p>

<p>“You’re not lying to me?”</p>

<p>“So help me God.”</p>

<p>He had expected her arms about his neck, but she gave him her hand like a man.</p>

<p>“I’ll never let you down,” she said shortly. “Let’s go.”</p>

<p>They went out under a sky of faint, clean blue, where a frosty moon queened it
amidst a scattering of small pale stars, and found a man who was driving out
of town in a wagon and went with him.</p>

<p>By one means and another they made their way into the Gray Dome country and
Jim built a cabin there.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>Fifteen years later, Rosie Briggs stood in the door of it and watched Jim
climb down the steep trail toward his latest prospect hole.</p>

<p>There was a fresh sprinkling of snow, so light and dry that the faint wind
started bits of it to rolling like feathers. Beneath it the smells of spruce
and pine and juniper and little silver mountain sage were dormant. The cold,
clean, thin air of early morning was stripped for the odor of Long Jim’s pipe,
and it drifted up, rank and acrid. Rosie liked it, at that hour and in that
place.</p>

<p>She watched him until he waved his hand far below like a tiny marionette
before he took the fork of the trail under the big Engelmann spruce and
disappeared for the day. She waved back and turned to her tubs. Every week she
washed the clothes of four families in Gray Dome, the mining town down the
main road just around the next bend. It was hard work, but she didn’t mind it
much.</p>

<p>She didn’t think about it. Besides, she only worked four days a week. The
other three she rested&mdash;sewed a little, crocheted a little, knit a
little&mdash;sweaters and stockings and mittens for Jim and herself, and kept her
diminutive house as clean as a chemist’s scales; or sat quietly out in front
in summer or inside by the stove in winter and let the long waves of peace
wash deeper and deeper in. Peace is good after a life like Rosie’s. She lay in
it thankfully, as in a bath, and soaked old stains away.</p>

<p>On the side of Gray Dome Mountain, with the sheer drop of the cañon at her
feet and the range spread out beyond; in the midst of cleanness and silence
unbroken since that old rocky backbone of the continent thrust itself up into
the sun, she had risen slowly out of the shards of the life of Captain Mac and
come, late but surely, into her heritage of womanliness and dignity. The years
had chipped away her prettiness, but in its place was beauty for those who
could see it. The smooth face had been sculptured into something fine and
strong and self-directed, something steadfast and serene. She wasn’t blown
about by tantrums any more.</p>

<p>She had a stake in the game of life now, and she played to hold it. She had
steadied to meet the responsibilities thrust upon her by Jim. He was as kind
and patient as the seasons, and as unreliable. And she was like a cottonwood
tree; she put out the leaves of her affection and confidence surely and
abundantly, but with tireless caution and she rarely got nipped. She
controlled him where he could be controlled, and where he couldn’t she
accepted him as she did the weather. Her knowledge of men was empirical,
unhampered by theories.</p>

<p>Jim would give anybody anything she had&mdash;he possessed nothing himself&mdash;and be
perennially surprized if she objected. Usually she didn’t, but if it was
something she wanted she went after it and got it back if she could. Any bum
or crook or sharper could win his friendship and pick his mind or his pocket
if either happened to have anything in it.</p>

<p>But Rosie’s mind was her own, and instead of a pocket she used the Conifer
County Savings Bank. She met him at all points as shrewdly as if he had been
an opponent&mdash;which in a sense he was&mdash;but she loved him. And she knew that he
loved her, and counted on it, but only for what it was worth.</p>

<p>She put more trust in his poverty. Every day, of course, he expected to strike
it. And for a while she had thought he might. But gradually as the days lay
themselves down in long, pleasantly monotonous rows until the sum of them made
many years, she came to know that he wouldn’t. And that, far more than his
love, was the foundation of her content. While he was poor he was
hers&mdash;wholly, unqualifiedly, unthinkingly hers.</p>

<p>Poor was scarcely the word, though. Jim lived in a moneyless world. Out of the
little she made she supplied the simple necessities of both of them, and he
was willing to wait for everything else until he struck it. “Then&mdash;! Then&mdash;!”
was what he thought of as he made his slow way up and down the mountainside.
To him the thought was roseate, luminous, rejuvenescent.</p>

<p>But Rosie hated it. If for nothing else, because it held the seeds of possible
change. After a chancy life, she valued most, of things attainable by human
beings, a life that was free from chances.</p>

<p>On this morning in spring an eagle slanted down the sky on wide, still wings;
the ice broke up and tinkled in Little Cub Creek in the cañon; the orange and
yellow shoots of the willows swelled out toward catkins; and Rosie washed her
clothes contentedly, secure in the knowledge that there was no “then”; while
over in his hole in the side of Old Baldy Jim broke up her world with quick
excited blows of a short-handled miner’s pick.</p>

<p>She was hanging out the clothes on the squawberry bushes at the back when she
heard the impatient crash of his elk hide boots. She went quickly through the
house and stopped in the front door at sight of him.</p>

<p>When he swung up his heavy bag of samples for a signal, she knew. Knew before
she heard his whoop. And when it cut across the stillness like the whistle of
a locomotive it struck her cold. It chilled the core of her spirit, as an icy
wind loosed in the tropics would chill a naked native.</p>

<p>“Struck it, by thunder! Two hundred dollars to the ton, if it’s worth a cent!
An’ the vein as plain as a layer ’o choc’late in a cake!”</p>

<p>He fell into a chair on the porch. Rosie stood and stared at him. The one
thing he knew was ore. He had the kind of knowledge that men had been willing
to pay for when he’d sell it. His “then” had come. The realization went
through her consciousness in widening rings. Whatever else it meant, it meant
the end of this; the beginning of uncertainty.</p>

<p>He caught her in his arms and swept her into the cabin and danced her about
until the place shook.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you? Didn’t I say you’d ride in your own auto yet? It had to
come, old lady, it jest nacherally had to come!”</p>

<p>He gave her a hug and turned her loose.</p>

<p>“I knowed it,” he said solemnly. “I’ve allus knowed it. Away down deep in
there&mdash;” he tapped his breast&mdash;“I’ve had a hunch.”</p>

<p>He flung himself into a chair and looked at her hard. “‘Ain’t you glad?” he
said suddenly.</p>

<p>She was like a boat that has luffed into the wind. For a moment her mental
sails hung flapping. Then they filled and strained and she set out before this
new cold breeze. She told him as best she could that she was glad.</p>

<p>“To look at you a feller might think you was kinder sorry like,” he said
quizzically. “What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“I was thinkin’ a little about how happy we’d been right here&mdash;just you and me
and the house you made yourself.”</p>

<p>“’Twarn’t a patch on what it’s gonna be,” he said, and jumped up and was off
with his samples to the assayer’s in Gray Dome. He stepped strongly, as a
young man does. Half the stoop was gone from his shoulders.</p>

<p>Rosie turned back slowly and sat down heavily at the kitchen table, her
occupation gone. Jim didn’t need a grubstaker now. She sat there a long time,
while memories of other miners who had got rich swarmed in her brain like
little devils that fell over each other in their eagerness to stab her:
Senator Sherrill, and Tom Potts, the hotel man, and Hooker Bates, who took his
flier in Wall Street; and Mike Watson, who divorced his wife for Dora
Schoonmaker, and a dozen others. They made their money and then were gathered
in by women like the Schoonmakers. She had seen so many of them. They always
left the women they had picked up when they were poor. Especially dance hall
women. Even when they were their wives.</p>

<p>And she and Jim had never been married.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>But Rosie Briggs wasn’t a quitter. Little in her life had gone by default.
When the terms of the sale of the mine had been arranged and everybody in
Conifer County knew that Jim was going to be a rich man, she capped his plans
with hers and squared about to meet what was coming. She went over her clothes
and spruced up as much as she could to match her new station. And very
carefully she laid down a program of buying to be carried out as soon as the
money came in.</p>

<p>Among her things she found a picture that she had clipped from a fashion
magazine twelve years ago&mdash;a colored picture of an electric-blue plush dress
of a style that she had admired. She felt a twinge of sadness as she wondered
how many other things that she had wanted and gone without would look as queer
as that now.</p>

<p>The dress she had worn when Jim took her out of the dance hall&mdash;the red dress
with the spangles on it&mdash;looked queerer, but that night while Jim was in the
village on an errand after supper she put it on and sat waiting for him by the
fire, determined to play such cards as she had.</p>

<p>When he came in he stopped at the door of the little sitting room with a
whistle of surprize.</p>

<p>“I ain’t seen that for ten years. Didn’t know you had it.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t much&mdash;” she said, smoothing the skirt.</p>

<p>She had lengthened and renovated it as best she could. It was the only piece
of finery she owned.</p>

<p>“It’s all right. Lord, how purty I uster think it was!”</p>

<p>The windows were open to the night. The weather had turned suddenly warm that
day, as if the old earth had decided to start life all over again with the
Briggses. There was a moon, and the new tender leaves of the aspens about the
cabin made patterns on it that twinkled. You could almost feel the soft wooly
anemones thrusting up their oval spear points outside.</p>

<p>The feel of it all had got into Rosie’s heart and driven out some of her
fears. She even had her old banjo in her lap. She wanted to prove to him that
she meant to help him to be happy. She touched the strings and began to sing.</p>

<p>She knew only the songs that had been popular a good while ago&mdash;“Daisy”, “Two
Little Girls in Blue”, “Sweet Rosie O’Grady” and one or two more of the same
sort. These, to her, were “music”&mdash;all there was of it. She sang:</p>

<div style='margin-left:2em;'>
“Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer true.<br>
I’m half crazy, just for the love of you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
</div>

<p class='ni'>and felt a load slipping from her heart as the snow slips from the
summit of Gray Dome Mountain when warm weather comes.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” Jim murmured. “You ain’t sung that sence&mdash;”</p>

<p>He let the sentence die. His eyes smiled above his grizzling brown mustache
and beard. She wanted to put down the banjo and go to him and touch his hand.
But she went on singing, pleased that she remembered the tune so well, that
her voice rang out so clear and true, and Jim came and sat close beside her.</p>

<p>A strange, deliciously sweet odor crept in under the smells of growing things
and wet earth out there on the dripping mountainside. She felt just then that
Jim was as steadfast and as sure to stand by as the huge silver spruce that
the cabin was built against. She let her cheek rest on the shoulder of his
coat.</p>

<div style='margin-left:2em;'>
“It won’t be a stylish marriage,<br>
For I can’t afford a carriage&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
</div>

<p>The odor came more strongly. It was like orange flowers. She smiled at the
sentimental notion. Orange flowers on the side of Gray Dome&mdash;</p>

<div style='margin-left:2em;'>
“But you’d look sweet&mdash;upon the seat<br>
Of a bicycle built&mdash;”
</div>

<p>The odor came from Jim’s coat.</p>

<p>It said suddenly, “Lorraine Schoonmaker,” as plainly as Jim’s lips could have
said it. To smell it was to see the girl standing behind the counter in the
Gray Dome Dry Goods Company’s store. Probably there was no one in town who
would have failed to connect her with that perfume.</p>

<p>A knife seemed to unfold inside of Rosie. It cut her song off in the middle of
the line and brought her upright in her chair with a gasp.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” Jim said, startled.</p>

<p>She got to her feet. She almost came straight out with it. That would have
been like her. It was what she wanted to do. But for the first time in many
years she was afraid. She stared at Jim with deep revulsion. Suddenly he was
part of an elemental horror that she had climbed out of long ago and that now
was closing around her again.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I hadn’t ought to’ve sung that,” she said thickly. “It&mdash;makes me think too
much of the old days,” and went stumbling off to the bedroom.</p>

<p>He followed her and stood around, saying things to comfort her, and finally
she pretended that her mood had passed. But when she lay still at last by his
side and thought about Lorraine Schoonmaker, hard lines pulled at the corners
of her mouth that hadn’t been there for fifteen years. Long after all traces
of it had vanished, she fancied that the air was faintly touched with the
perfume of orange flowers.</p>

<p>“Women” would have been bad enough, but he would have tired of them and come
back. There’d be no coming back from this girl of twenty-one, clever and hard
of mind and soft and pink of body, with the first taste of what money could do
fresh in her mouth.</p>

<p>Men didn’t come back from the Schoonmaker women. Behind Lorraine, with her
sleek black pomaded hair, her short tight pussy-willow taffeta one piece gown,
her chiffon stockings and high-heeled satin pumps with rhinestone buckles, her
vanity case almost as big as a traveling bag, her jeweled wrist watch and
swinging bead girdle, Rosie saw Ally Schoonmaker, her older sister, who had
married Timothy Bund practically on his death-bed for his house and his shares
in the North Star Mine. And behind Ally, up the ladder of the years a rung or
two, Dora Schoonmaker, breaking up the Watson home when Mike Watson’s mine
began to pay, and somehow juggling him into a divorce from the woman who had
seen him through the lean grim years of penury and into marriage with her and
then carrying him off East. And Effie, the oldest of the four, who had run
away with Perce Williams, nearly two decades her junior, when he came into his
father’s money, and held him grimly to her side ever since.</p>

<p>Yes, and even Bertha Schoonmaker, the mother, with her wig and her dirty
chiffon blouses and her painted cheeks and brown teeth and pink-lined hats
with floating pink veils, playing the man-game still, at sixty-four. Their
lean, rapacious Schoonmaker hands were all alike. If Lorraine took Jim, she’d
take him to keep. At the altar. For very definite financial ends of her own.</p>

<p>The tacit bargain between Long Jim and Rosie had never got itself into words;
they hadn’t felt the need of them. He had pulled her out of hell. The strength
of her allegiance to him couldn’t be increased by the mere saying of words,
however sacred, or the giving of a ring. Marriage would have added nothing to
her side of it. Nor, she had thought, to his. She wished now that she had it,
but it had not occurred to her to wish it before. She had had something so
much solider in poverty. Marriage might hold and it might not, but while he
had been dependent upon her for his food and clothes, there had been no doubt.</p>

<p>She went back to that over and over that night, seeing the placid years in the
little house as very beautiful through a mist of pain. She had a feeling that,
pulling at the almost forgotten cadences of the song, she had brought the past
down about her ears. She felt the old trapped fatalistic despair and sick
rage, without the old vigor. Something began banking up inside of her,
steadily, relentlessly. She was terribly afraid of it. It seemed to her that
it was a great bubble of black blood in her brain, and that when it
burst&mdash;&nbsp;She tried to keep from thinking to ease the strain on it, but her
thoughts streamed out swiftly from oubliettes in obscure corners of her mind.</p>

<p>They were hideous thoughts and really not hers at all. It seemed that some
devil sent them to torture her. The unfairness of it gagged in her throat. She
had fought her way out of filth and blackness to cleanness and the sun, and
now, without volition, the old horror came on her again from within&mdash;clicked
through her brain like yards and yards of cinema film. The current of her life
had swept past its one clean tranquil place and was swirling along muddied and
normal. The familiar ache was in her heart, and Rosie was herself
again&mdash;Captain Mac, of Al’s Dance Hall. You didn’t get away from things like
that.</p>

<p>Well, there were things that Captain Mac knew how to do that Rosie Briggs had
forgotten. She had whipped a can along the street once with revolver bullets
as a child whips a hoop to the admiration of every idle man in town, and ended
the demonstration by shooting a stranger’s plug hat off his head without
disturbing his hair. Her whirling thoughts showed her Jim’s old .44 in the
left-hand end of the bottom drawer of the dresser.</p>

<p>She must wait, she told herself&mdash;and her heart gave a great bound&mdash;she must
wait until she had them together! She laughed out with sudden raucous cruelty
in the still cool night. Jim stirred in his sleep but didn’t waken. She raised
herself on one elbow and looked down at him, while her thoughts raced and
danced, piling themselves into the bubble.</p>

<p>And then it burst and left her weak with compassion, seeing them together in
her mind’s eye; seeing them as clearly as the daylight that was climbing over
Gray Dome Mountain. That fragile, empty, smart little thing and Long Jim
Briggs! Gaunt, weathered, grizzled old Jim&mdash;and her! She’d no more be able to
shoot than to enter into her dead mother’s womb and be born again.</p>

<p>Feeling as old as the granite hills that ramparted the cañon, and with
something too of their plain ineluctable dignity, she arose and dressed
herself and built the breakfast fire in the stove.</p>

<p>When Jim came out to her she got slowly to her feet, closed the damper and
faced him.</p>

<p>“Jim,” she said, “that girl don’t want you. Take a good look at yourself in
the mirror over there, and then think of her. She’ll throw you away like a
sucked orange when the money’s gone.”</p>

<p>Long Jim Briggs stood up with his head in the rafters of the tiny room and
stared like an idiot.</p>

<p>“I smelled her perfumery on your coat,” said Rosie shortly, and comprehension
dawned slowly in his face.</p>

<p>“Holy jumping June bugs!” he said from somewhere down in his boots. “So that’s
what you thought! Wait a minute. I was hidin’ it in the wood house. I wanted
to surprize you.”</p>

<p>In a moment he returned with a package. With awkward swift movements he ripped
off the wrapping paper and shook out the folds of a brilliant electric blue
plush dress of a fashion fallen into forgotten desuetude ten years before.</p>

<p>He displayed it pridefully down the front of his long person, head a-cock and
a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“That’s all there was between us! Smell it!” The room reeked of orange
blossoms. “She made it for me nights, to make some extra money. It’s the kind
you kep’ a picture of from a fashion book. I got it off your dresser. Do
you&mdash;do you like it, Rosie?”</p>

<p>She tried to speak, but could only nod her head. He patted her shoulder
awkwardly. The dress swam before her eyes like a pane of blue glass in the
rain.</p>

<p>“It’s goin’ to be the swellest weddin’,” he said huskily, “that little old
Gray Dome ever seen. An’ then&mdash;” he cleared his throat with a rumble like
summer thunder&mdash;“we’re goin’ to Denver an’ buy a house on Capitol Hill an’ the
finest auto in town, an’ a nigger to run it an’ drive around an’ tell ’em all
to go to hell!”</p>
